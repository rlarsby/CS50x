All of the code I've written participating in the edX course CS50x Introduction to Computer Science between November 2020 and January 2021.
Please not that I do now own all of this code since some of it was prewritten in the exercise handout.
<br> Except the final project the pset9/finance exercise is the one that displays the level of programming achieved in this course.
<br> Pset1-7 followed the syllabus of CS50 2020: https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/
<br> Pset8-9 follow the syllabus of CS50 2021: https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/
<br> Final project: https://github.com/rlarsby/website
